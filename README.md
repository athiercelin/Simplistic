*NOTES (Jul 08, 2016): I've abandonned this project since Apple brought the reminder's app to the watch. This is completly redundant and will only be used for experimentation on my side.*

Simplistic is a dirt simple, easy to use checklist app for iPhone, iPod and Apple Watch.
It's the perfect app to handle groceries, DIY projects, daily duties and/or office projects.

All controls are gesture based to maximize the efficiency:

iPhone/iPod: 

- One finger long touch to create a new item.
- One finger single tap to mark item as done/undone.
- Two fingers long touch to delete done items right away. (Otherwise, automatically removed after 24hrs)

Watch:

- One finger single tap to mark item as done/undone.
- Force Touch shows the menu to delete done items right away. (Otherwise, automatically removed after 24hrs)
